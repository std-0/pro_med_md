                              The night lens or orthokeratology - is a means of correction of vision through the contact lens,
                                which has effect during the night, when you sleep and daytime lets you see clearly ..  </p>

                                        <b>How does it work?</b>
                                        <p>
                                            The lens influences the upper layer of the cornea.Consequently, the refraction of the bright rays and focus
                                            changes / change.Immediately, after removal of the lens, the sight is high.This allows patients
                                            To see excellent during the day and then wear the lenses again overnight.
                                           The phenomenon of changing the corneal refraction is changed exactly at the cornea.
                                           In the morning, the shape of the cornea is kept, the image focuses on the retina and the person receives 100% visual acuity.</p>

                                        For comfort: the optical effect is observed after six - eight hours.In the morning when you remove the lens and during the day,
                                         The sight remains good.After the first night the vision will be improved at 70-75% after a few nights definitive 100% view,
                                         process of increasing improvement.The lens only at night while sleeping changes the cornea when we sleep due to its optical shapei>

                                Many doctors around the world are using orthogeratology lenses today to stop myopia in children and adolescents.
                                 Studies show that children using orthogeneology lenses have a marked reduction in myopia compared to children
                                 that use other types of correction.<br>
                                 Therefore, such lenses have another name - refractive therapy (CRT).This name was first used by
                                 The American Paragon company, which was the first in the world that developed orthogeneous lenses for night wearing.

                                <p>
                                 Paragon CRT (Paragon Vision Sciences) is a global orthogeratology brand that was the first in the world that received
                                  FDA approval for overnight use of orthogeneology lenses and developed design technology and
                                  Custom adaptation for these lenses called Cornea Refractive Therapy (CRT).Paragon lenses are made of a unique material,
                                  Very permeable to oxygen, which gives them high safety. </p>

                               Indeed, doctors always say you should not sleep with the usual contact lenses.
                                However, orthogenesis lenses are designed and manufactured from ultra-permeable oxygen,
                                What allows them to be worn all night without any additional risk to the patient's health or corneal damage.</p>
