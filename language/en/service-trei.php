                                <b>CAtaract is an ophthalmic disorder, frequent, which causes progressive decrease in vision by losing the transparency of the crystalline.</b> <br>
                               Cataract can be congenital or acquired.Studies show that about 70% of people over 65 suffers from this condition, but there are cases where this condition can be encountered in younger people.</p>
                                <p>
                               It can be formed on any of the three layers of the lens: capsule, cortex or nucleus.On the other hand, cataracts discovered in cortical or nuclear areas are associated with aging ages.The risk of developing cortical cataracts increases with excessive exposure to UV rays.</p>
                                <p>
                                In stadiile avansate, netratata, aceasta afectiune poate produce complicatii grave. De cele mai multe ori, ambii ochi sunt afectati, fara ca scaderea vederii sa fie insotita de durere. Pacientul acuza scaderea progresiva a vederii sau incetosarea acesteia. Se poate intampla ca mai multe tipuri de cataracta sa se dezvolte in cadrul aceluiasi ochi. Calitatea vederii poate fi favorizata sau defavorizata, in functie de tipul cataractei, de lumina zilei sau de lumina difuza. Schimbarea ochelarilor, in nenumarate randuri, este un proces facut in zadar in acest caz, pacientul fiind tot mai nemultumit de calitatea vederii sale.
                               In advanced, untreated stages, this condition can produce serious complications.Most of the time, both eyes are affected, without decreasing vision to be accompanied by pain.The patient accuses the progressive decrease in vision or celebration.It can happen that several types of cataracts develop in the same eye.Vision quality can be favored or disadvantaged, depending on the cataract type, daylight or diffuse light.Changing glasses, in countless rows, is a process made in vain in this case, the patient being more and more dissatisfied with the quality of his vision.iv>

                               Today's technology is extremely advanced, making cataract surgery only last for a few minutes.It is done with local anesthesia without admission and is not painful.Vision recovery is most often spectacular. </p>

                               Ultrasound operation (facoemulsification), with a foldable artificial crystalline implant (foldable) is the most modern method of treatment, making it so small that suture (stitch) is not needed. </p>

                               The treatment of juvenile cataract depends on how it interferes with the normal development of visual sense.In some cases, surgery among people with cataracts is required for another associated ophthalmic pathology, such as diabetic retinopathy or macular degeneration.Also, in some cases, cataracts should be removed by an ophthalmologist specializing in the treatment of retina and optic nerve diseases. </p>
