                                Any surgery performed to correct the deformities and / or malformations of the eyes and the surrounding components may be called oculoplastic surgery.Structures such as the bone orbit of the eye, eyelids and lacrimal channels, as well as cheeks and skin in the adjacent area are included.</ p><p>
                                A combination of reconstruction and plastic surgery can be carried out by specialized ophthalmologists or oculoplast surgeons to restore the function and shape of the tissues involved.Oculoplastic procedures can be classified as functional and reconstructive eyelid operations, lacrimal channel operations and surgical and non-surgical cosmetic operations.</p>

                                <p>
                                There are many diseases justifying oculoplastic surgery.The lesions or anomalies of the eye itself, eyebrows, eyelids, orbits, cheeks and forehead are the main indications for oculoplastic surgery.
                                Facial or forehead abnormalities include cancers and excrescences around or in the eye, ptoose (ie fallen eyelids), weakness of facial muscles caused by diseases such as Bell's paralysis or eye problems that occur in diseases such as serious illness.</p>

                                              Ptoza may be congenital or acquired due to diseases such as old age or long-term use of

                                              The inappropriately positioned eyelids can be seen as the return (ie entropion) or outside (ie Etropion) of the eyelids.
                                               This requires surgery to restore the eyelids to their physiological position to function in their normal ability,
                                               that protects the eye surface. Removing tumors on the eyelids, or injuries arising from trauma, are often directions

                                               Cysts, oraser, moles and cutaneous labels are among the most common benign lesions that require removal from the eyelids.
                                                In patients with Bell paralysis, damage to the seventh cranial nerve can lead to weakness of the face, affecting uni or bilateral

                                   But there is a significantly increased risk of combining abscesses and acute lacrimal bag infection.</p>

                               <p>If, for example, there is an acute lacrimal bag infection, then antibiotics are administered for about a week.
                                   This can be followed by surgery to treat the obstruction of lacrimal ducts that usually opens in the nasal cavity.

                                   Surgical cosmetic operations can be used for blepharoplasty, which is done to repair the shape and tone of the eyelids left and
                                    weaken as we grow old.Lax muscle, bulging fat and excess skin can be removed to get the desired effect - a younger look.</p>

                                   In addition to blepharoplasty, there is also the lifting of the face of the eyebrows and the forehead, as well as improving the fold of the eyelids.
                                    Patients opting for non-surgical cosmetic pathways can use dermal fillers (eg hyaluronic gels),
                                    Neuromodulators (e.g., Botox) and injectable fat grafts and / or abdomen transfers on the face. </p>
