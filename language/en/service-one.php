                                <p>
                               Miopia is a defect of vision that is manifested by the impossibility of clearly distinguishing the objects located at a greater distance.
                                This happens because parallel rays, which come from an object, when crossing the eyeball, focus ahead of the retina,
                                only allowing the distinction of objects at a lower distance.The eyeball of men is more elongated,
                                Being divergent lenses to correct the sight, moving the outbreak on the retina. </p>
                                <h5>How do we find out if we have myopia?</h5>
                                <p>The symptoms of myopia are discussed a lot, but the main symptom of myopia is the emergence of difficulties in distance,
                                    Thus, patients are presented in ophthalmological consultation, where the value of special devices (dioptron) is established.
                                    Diopters and doctor recommends their correction variants.Also, following the specialized consultation, the degree is set
                                    myopia and if there are associated eyepieces.</p>

                                        <li>Mare myopia (over 6 diopters);</li>
                                        <li>If the value is over 9-10 diopses then it is myopia forces or pathologic myopia.</li>

                                   One of the most modern and efficient methods of treatment is the Machine Correction Operation,
                                     Miopia operation As it is known, through which the global refractive of the eye is achieved
                                      and eliminating the need for eyeglasses or contact lenses.Myopia surgery can be done with the laser or by
                                      Replacement of the crystalline with an artificial crystalline (similar to the cataract surgery).
